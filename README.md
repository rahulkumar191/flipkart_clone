# Flipkart Frontend Clone - Responsive Web Design
This project is a clone of the Flipkart ecommerce website's frontend, made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clone is designed to be responsive, meaning it can adjust its layout and content based on the screen size of the device it is being viewed on.

The aim of this project is to showcase the developer's ability to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface, as well as demonstrate their proficiency in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive web pages.
